I will generate the `Greeting` component for the Coffee World application based on the provided tracker. This component receives a `message` prop and renders it with specified Tailwind CSS classes for text styling. There's no state, event handling, or animation required.

The component is straightforward. It needs to accept a `message` prop of type string and render it within a `div` element. Tailwind CSS classes will be used to style the text, setting font size, color, and alignment, to create the intended coffee-themed welcome message. It does not require the "use client" directive.
