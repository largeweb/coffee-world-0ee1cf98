<analysis>The tracker outlines a simple "Coffee World" app. The main page (src/app/page.tsx) will display a coffee-themed greeting and use a coffee bean background image. It does not require state management, data fetching, animation, or API integration. It needs to use Tailwind CSS for styling and load the background image correctly.</analysis>
<reasoning>Based on the description, the `src/app/page.tsx` file will render the `Greeting` component and set the background image. Since the image is in the `public` directory, it can be referenced directly using its path.  I'll use Tailwind CSS classes to center the content, set the background image, and ensure proper responsiveness. The page needs to be a client component because it will use the image and Tailwind attributes, so I need to add the "use client" directive.
